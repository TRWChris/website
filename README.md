# Interstellar Clinic

A futuristic medical clinic web experience built with React, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS—designed to run seamlessly on **bolt.new**.

## Quick Start (in Bolt)

1. Upload or import this project zip into your Bolt workspace.  
2. In the **Terminal** (or Command Prompt in Bolt), run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Bolt will auto‑detect Vite and show a Preview window.

3. Customise content inside **src/components**.  
4. Deploy to your custom domain straight from Bolt when you’re happy.

### Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **Vite 5**  
- **Tailwind CSS 3** for styling  
- **Framer Motion** for micro‑animations  
- **Three.js** via **@react-three/fiber**/**drei** for the 3‑D hero scene  
- **React Router 6** for client‑side routing

> _Note: Most back‑end functionality (real‑time scheduling, HIPAA‑grade auth, etc.) is stubbed. Swap in your own API calls where marked._
